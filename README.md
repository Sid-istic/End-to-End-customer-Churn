# End-to-End-customer-Churn
Predicting customer churn using Machine Learning to help businesses retain customers. End-to-End project with future scalability for NLP feedback analysis &amp; deployment.

# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave) a service using supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## 🏆 Project Objective
To build an ML model that accurately predicts customer churn, helping businesses retain customers by taking proactive actions.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Pickle (Model saving)
- Gzip(compress large files)
- Google Colab
- Git & GitHub for version control
